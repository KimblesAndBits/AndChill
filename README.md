Unit 8: Project 1:
Overview: Welcome to Project 1! This is an important step in your full-stack journey as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

Key Topics:
* Server-side APIs
* Git branching workflow
* Agile software development

Our Goal:
This App will give you recommendations for a perfect night at home. Including recommendations based on mood for books, movies, and nearby food options.

App asks users these questions:
* How are you feeling today?
  * Select by mood (happy, optimistic, sad, anxious, playful, slaphappy, etc)
* Do you prefer books or movies?
  * We could have the app recommend either a book or a movie (or potentially both) based on user input.
* What is your favorite food?
  * Search by type (pizza, burgers, mexican, asian, etc) and get recommendations based on your location.
